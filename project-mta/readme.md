info on the scripts in project-mta\
by Wy Ming Lin, brain rhythms lab\
updated 08 March 2020

- scripts need the FieldTrip and obob_\cf2 ownft toolboxes (obob: https://gitlab.com/obob/obob_ownft)
- scripts folder contains command script that runs all functions one by one and does all either locally on computer or sends everything to the DCCN cluster for parallel processing
- time windows and paths should be updated if you use these scripts for your own project


- any questions? send me an email at wlin7439@gmail.com or find me on slack
