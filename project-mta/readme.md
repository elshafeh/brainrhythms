updated 08 March 2020

- scripts need the FieldTrip and obob_\cf2 ownft toolboxes (obob: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://gitlab.com/obob/obob_ownft"}}{\fldrslt \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\ul https://gitlab.com/obob/obob_ownft}}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\ul )\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \ulnone \
- scripts folder contains command script that runs all functions one by one and does all either locally on computer or sends everything to the DCCN cluster for parallel processing\
- time windows and paths should be updated if you use these scripts for your own project\
